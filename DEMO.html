			<h3>Robert Harris | Student ID: 15618571</h3>

		<div id="CL_Intro">
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The assessment brief for the CMP1130M Assessment item 1 was to design an interactive website for a band or brand and examine the strengths and weaknesses of the current web specifications and standards which we were required to use while developing the website. 
			Therefore, the website has been developed using HTML5 for the content and CSS3 for the styling of the content. The latest versions of jQuery and JavaScript were used to increase the functionality of the website. 
			The standards were used to feature hyperlinks, text effects, multimedia, local web storage, geolocation and advanced JavaScript functionality. 
			To ensure quality of the website we collected user feedback during the design process of wireframing, where subsequent feedback was turned into changes or improvements.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="CL_Web_Standards">
			<h1>Web Standards and Validation</h1>
			<p>Using the latest web standards means development is easier as there is more support from experienced users to receive help from and makes maintenance easier as interoperability is stronger. 
			This also allows maintenance and running costs to be lower. Using a range of web specifications and standards, splits up the content customisation allowing for more control over the functionality of the website. 
			HTML5 requires less maintenance and is quick to code as it is one code base for all operating systems, making it a cost-effective solution for developing a site for multiple platforms (PC, tablet, phone etc…). 
			It is also very widely used so support online is in large supply and learning it will become a very useful skill. However, it can be difficult to link the code to the other standards if you are inexperienced, on the other hand, this is mainly a fault with the other standards as html is the main code. 
			CSS3 makes it easy to control how the HTML looks but requires a lot of lines and is very different to HTML and causes the downloading of HTML pages to increase if CSS is embedded, again, it is widely used. 
			However, certain CSS code requires files to be installed on the user’s computer such as font. JavaScript is a simple programming language but can be annoying when programming as error messages are quite vague and unhelpful. 
			JS can be used to massively increase the functionality of your website. jQuery is a helpful tool to increases functionality of JavaScript, to create and use local storage, but as it uses API’s, error messages are very vague and can be hard to debug, there is support online, but less than other standards like CSS.
			Overall, using a range of web standards requires coding to be stricter during development so that the standards can work together. This may have an impact on the result of the website as stricter coding requires a higher programming knowledge and is harder to achieve validation from W3C. Commenting has also been used so any other programmer could either learn from the code or edit it.

			<h1>Methods</h1>
			<p>To meet current web standards, HTML5 has been used to get the latest HTML elements and to allow the site to have accessibility in the future, anticipating that the website will be used for the foreseeable future.</p>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure1" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure1.jpg">Figure 1 – ‘Head’ element of the HTML code in the index (home) page, remains the same for most pages, linking the style sheet and JS files</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure2" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure2.jpg">Figure 2 – ‘Head’ element of the HTML code for the news page, shows a twitter widget being linked</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure3" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure3.jpg">Figure 3 – ‘Head’ element of the HTML code for the shop, shows more API’s for jQuery </div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure4" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure4.jpg">Figure 4 – part of the ‘Body’ element which displays home button and navigation bar, constant on every page</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure5" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure5.jpg">Figure 5 – shows a table element plus table child elements in use, also shows only inline styling in entire HTML</div>
			<p>Figures 1 through 3 show a stylesheet being linked to the html on multiple pages, CSS3 has been used throughout the website linking to the HTML elements via the external stylesheet. 
			The stylesheet applies styling to the elements with little inline, only where external is otherwise difficult. 
			The stylesheet also changes the styling depending on the size of the window via media queries, to prevent overflow issues and help with support for other devices such as phones and tablets. 
			Techniques like defining size by a percentage over fixed size so it scales better has been used and using table cells, so they don’t overflow off the page.	</p>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure6" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure6.jpg">Figure 6 – shows one of the media queries for different rules for different screen widths </div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure7" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure7.jpg">Figure 7 – shows the table-cell in use on the shop page as well as a table section using a percentage size</div>
			<p>To add more functionality to the website, JavaScript and jQuery have been used to change some HTML and CSS based on user inputs, to save the users shopping cart to local storage with a drag and drop feature for adding items to the shopping cart.</p>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure8" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure8.png">Figure 8 – the $(document).ready function ensures the DOM is loaded before the Script is run. Also shows a data grid being created in jQuery </div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure9" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure9.jpg">Figure 9 – shows local storage being checked (if present) and being set to a variable if present after being converted to an array through JSON</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure10" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure10.jpg">Figure 10 – shows jQuery data grid being loaded</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure11" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure11.jpg">Figure 11 – shows the shop item being made draggable, as well as the jQuery changing the CSS of the object</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure12" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure12.jpg">Figure 12 – shows a droppable area being made for objects</div>
			<div class="Figure_Tag"><img id="Figure13" src="Assets/Critical_Log/Figure13.jpg">Figure 13 – sets an item into local storage, also shows html table being changed</div>
